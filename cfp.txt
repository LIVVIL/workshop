== Logging Interactive Visualizations & Visualizing Interaction Logs ==
=======================================================================

A IEEE Vis 2016 workshop, October 23rd or 24th 2016, Baltimore, MD, USA (http://ieeevis.org/)

We invite visualization researchers and practitioners to share their best practices and tools for logging their online visualizations.

In particular, we are interested in tackling the following log-related issues:

* How to log users interactions in a visualization system?
* How to design effective logging systems?
* How to make sense of those logs?
* How to deal with legal and ethical issues related to logging?
* How to design logs-based visualizations or any other application using log data?
