      <h1><span style='text-align: left'>Logging Interactive Visualizations</span><br><span style='text-align: center'>&</span><br><span style='text-align: right'>Visualizing Interaction Logs</span></h1>
  
      <p>A workshop hosted during the upcoming <a href="http://ieeevis.org/">IEEE VIS 2016</a> conference, which is the premier venue for visualization. The workshop is open to anyone who previously registered at the conference. This website is still in progress, please come back frequently to get updates. Or <a href='mailto:romain.vuillemot@gmail.com'>contact us</a> directly.</p>

      <p>This workshop addresses the following issues:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>How to captures users interactions in a visualization system?</li>
        <li>How to make sense of the users behavior?</li>
        <li>How to deal with legal and ethic issues?</li>
        <li>How to design visualizations or any other application using logs data?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We invite IEEE Vis participants to contribute to this workshop in order to achieve the following goals:</p>
      
      <h4>A Standard Logging Format</h4>

      <p>The first step when setting up a logging process is to ask what should be recorded, when it should be recorded, and how (by the web server, by the application itself, etc.). For example, even a simple and ubiquitous interaction, like a mouse dragging, requires carefully considerations as it can generate a lot of noisy events resulting in very large and thus difficult to interpret log files.</p>
  
      <ul>
        <li>How to record low-level interactions (mouse moves, keystroke, ...) and data-intensive interactions (dynamic queries, brushing and linking, ...) efficiently?</li>
        <li>How to track multiple and coordinated views? How to track the view the user currently focuses on?</li>
        <li>What is the scope of the context that should be recorded beyond user's interaction? Desktop UI configuration? Computer and office setup?</li>
        <li>How to record collaborative and multi-device activities?</li>
        <li>How to reduce the size of data intensive interactions? Should there by a low frequency / interaction sampling, filtering and/or aggregation to shrink log files? Should there be any buffering strategy?</li>
        <li>Is the Common Log Format (IP, User ID, Timestamp, etc.) generated by web servers, expressive enough to be the standard for Infovis? What are the related and upcoming standards (W3C, others)? Should Infovis define its own log format?</li>
      </ul>
